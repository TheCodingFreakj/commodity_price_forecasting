Key Metrics and Signs of Model Failure

High Error Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Indicates large deviations between actual and predicted values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Amplifies large errors due to squaring.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE; interpretable in the same units as the target.
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Percentage error, useful for scale-independent evaluation.



Variance in the dependent variable refers to the degree to which the values of the dependent variable 
(or target variable) differ from their mean.
It is a measure of how spread out the observed data points are around their average value.

A high variance in the dependent variable means the observed values are widely spread out from the mean.
A low variance indicates the observed values are closely clustered around the mean.


Low R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Measures how much variance in the target is explained by the model.
Ranges from 0 to 1 (or can be negative if the model is worse than a baseline).



When the moving average is trending upwards, it indicates a positive trend in prices.
When the moving average flattens or trends downward, it may indicate a slowdown or reversal in the trend.
The gap between the moving average and the original price reflects the volatility of the data.


Pandas Profiling: Automatically generates a detailed report of your data, including statistical summaries, missing data, correlations, etc.
Seaborn: Creates insightful visualizations (pair plots, heatmaps, distributions, etc.) to better understand the relationships and distributions in your data.
Statsmodels/Scikit-Learn: Performs statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, regression analysis) and feature selection to identify important predictors for modeling.
